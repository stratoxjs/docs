# Stratox.js - Template engine

The Stratox template library is created using up-to-date methods, keeping its size at around 6 kb when bundled and minimized (gzipped). It works independently, smoothly running on all platforms without needing anything else. Stratox.js is a smart pick for applications and websites, ensuring great performance and quick load time. It's versatile, letting you load views asynchronously (with optional caching) or bundle them conveniently into your main JavaScript file.

### User-Friendly

Stratox is very user-friendly because it lets you prioritize JavaScript and HTML instead of grappling with the complexities of new markup and platform-specific functions, which in the end only lead to the burden of unnecessary abstractions. Stratox harnesses JavaScript's core capabilities, promoting a practical and fundamental approach to modern web development.

### Platform-agnostic nature

Stratox.js doesn't discriminate or judge based on the platform you use, and it works seamlessly on all platforms and depends on nothing but it self.

### Full accessibility support

Moreover, by allowing developers to write regular HTML with the right semantics, Stratox.js ensures that the resulting interfaces are fully **accessible**. This dual emphasis on simplicity and accessibility makes Stratox.js a powerful tool for creating user-friendly and inclusive web applications.
